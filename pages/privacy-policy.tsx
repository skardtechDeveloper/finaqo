                                                <p>SEBI vide its circular SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2020/253 dated 31st December, 2020 has decided the timings for NAV applicability for purchase of units of mutual fund schemes (except liquid and overnight funds)     to     be     effective     from     1st     February,     2021.     Also,     SEBI     vide     its     notification <u>SEBI/HO/1MD/DF2/OW/P/2020/18832/1 dated 6th November, 2020 had decided to restore the cut-off  timings  for  subscription  and  redemption  for  all  mutual  fund  schemes  to  its  original  timings  (as mentioned  in  the  below  table).  However,  Paisabazaar  as  a  registered  SEBI  intermediary,  works  with payment gateway providers and other system participants (in the mutual fund industry for collections and  settlements,  SEBI  vide  its  circular  SEBI/HO/MRD/DSA/CIR/P/2016/113  allowed  SEBI  registered investment advisors to use the infrastructure of recognized stock exchanges to purchase and redeem mutual funds units directly from AMCs on behalf of their clients, including direct plans. Accordingly, NSE  is  the  platform  partner  of  Paisabazaar  and  therefore  we  have  external  dependencies  on  their systems. Thus, the applicability of NAV in respect of purchase of mutual fund schemes is subject to the realization and availability of funds in the AMC’s bank accounts before the applicable cut-off timings.</u></p>
